Hi Everyone,
Welcome to the GS_Grossmargin_Data report.

ðŸ“Š Report Overview and Dynamic Features:
This report has been built with several dynamic and interactive elements for enhanced analysis and insights:

1. Sales and Gross Margin Visualizations
Sales Amount and GM Amount are represented as gray and green columns, respectively.

Each column includes data labels:

GM Amount labels turn yellow if GM Percent is less than 10%

Green if GM Percent exceeds 50%

The data is dynamically filtered based on the selected filters in the header.

2. Product Category Analysis
The X-axis displays Product Categories with drill-through functionality enabled.

Users can drill through by Category, Subcategory, Model, or SKU to access detailed product-level insights.

Note:

Gross Margin (GM) = Sales Amount â€“ Cost Amount

GM Percent = GM Amount Ã· Sales Amount

3. Price Bracket Insights
Products are grouped into List Price Brackets (USD), with prices rounded to the nearest cent.

Brackets are displayed in the following order:
0â€“10, 10â€“20, 20â€“50, 50â€“100, 100â€“200, 200â€“500, 500â€“1000, 1000â€“2000, 2000â€“5000

Key metrics shown along the column axis (all in USD accounting format):

GM Amount

GM Percent

Red if < 0%

Green if > 50%

AUR (Average Unit Retail) = Sales Amount Ã· Sales Quantity

AUC (Average Unit Cost) = Cost Amount Ã· Sales Quantity

PPP Sales = Percent Penetration to Parent for Sales Amount

4. Bubble Chart for Sales
